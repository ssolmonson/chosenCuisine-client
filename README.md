### Planning Story

My Dad's thought while watching the phantom gourmet to have an easy to use app in order to keep track of restaurants to go to. Expanding on this thought I decided to work on including a mapped location for clarity and use a rating system.

##### Future Goals:

- Include a dynamic map integration, would utilize a more interactive map (Google map integration).
- Raiting system
- Expand on the rating system: Create a new resource where ratings will be tied to one restaurant but will be able to be viewed by any user. Similar to reviews on a product. A restaurant would have many ratings.
- Clean up/stream-line navigation, and route paths.
